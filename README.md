# Talk Stream Backend

The Talk Stream Backend is the backend repository for the [Talk Stream Application](https://github.com/Yczar/talk-stream), a web-based chat application that allows users to join chat rooms and communicate with other users in real-time. The app is built using Dart Frog, a backend web framework for the Dart programming language.

## Features

- Real-time messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
- Chat rooms: Users can chat with other users of the application.
- User authentication: Users must create an account and login before they can use the app.
- Emojis: Users can add emojis to their messages.

The Talk Stream Backend is an example of how to build a complete API using Dart Frog, including real-time communication with web sockets. If you're interested in building a similar application or learning more about Dart Frog, feel free to explore the code and documentation.
